    <!--

      Include the main three.js script.

      The global variable THREE will be
      available for use in any scripts
      loaded after this one.

    -->

    <script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.js"></script>

    <!--

      Include the OrbitControls script.

      This must be included AFTER the three.js script as it
      needs to use the global THREE variable

    -->

    <script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js"></script>

		<!--

			Include the GLTFLoader script. This also needs to be loaded after the three.js script

		-->

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"></script>

		<!--

			Include post processing base files.

			EffectComposer: used to combine any post processing passes and output
			the final result onto our screen

			RenderPass: render the initial scene for use by later passes

			ShaderPass: takes in any of the files from the examples/js/shaders
			directory and turns them in to a post processing pass

		-->

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js"></script>
		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/RenderPass.js"></script>
		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js"></script>

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/postprocessing/OutlinePass.js"></script>


		<!--

			Include any shader files that we want to use as post processing passes.
			We could also use the examples/js/shaders/BasicShader.js files as a starting point
			to write our own

			CopyShader: This one doesn't apply any additional effect, but it's used
			internall by most other shaders

		-->

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/shaders/CopyShader.js"></script>

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/shaders/KaleidoShader.js"></script>


		<!--

			Include our App class. In a production environment, we would be setting
			up a build process and importing this as a module, but for simplicity here
			we'll include it the old fashioned way.

			See discoverthreejs.com/modules/three-app/ for an example of how to do that.
