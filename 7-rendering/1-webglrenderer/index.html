      Include the main three.js script.

      The global variable THREE will be
      available for use in any scripts
      loaded after this one.

    <!--

      Include the OrbitControls script.

      This must be included AFTER the three.js script as it
      needs to use the global THREE variable

    -->

		<!--

			Include the GLTFLoader script. This also needs to be loaded after the three.js script

		-->

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"></script>

		<!--

			Include our App class. In a production environment, we would be setting
			up a build process and importing this as a module, but for simplicity here
			we'll include it the old fashioned way.

			See discoverthreejs.com/modules/three-app/ for an example of how to do that.
