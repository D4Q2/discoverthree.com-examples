			Include the main three.js script.

			The global variable THREE will be available for use in any scripts loaded
			after this one.

			Note that this is not the ideal way of including this script - in a production app you
			would be importing it as a module in some way. We could do that here,
			but unfortunately plugins such as OrbitControls are not yet available as modules
			so we will include it the old fashioned way for now.

			Include the OrbitControls script.

			This must be included AFTER the three.js script as it

				Finally, include the script that runs your three.js app.

				We include this in the footer, since it means that all html elements have
				loaded and we can operate on them in our app.

				If we included it in the <head> section then we might run into a problem
				where the <body> section has not finished loading by the time we are trying to use it.
